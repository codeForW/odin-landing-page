# odin-landing-page

The Odin Project - CSS Foundation curriculum.
The goal is to build a page according to the design. The design has been given by the lesson, and start from a blank document.

 - I think it might have been better to work on this with box-sizing enabled instead.
 - Will need to rework the entire CSS at some point.
